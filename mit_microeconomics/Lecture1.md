# Lecture 1: Introduction and Suppy and Demand

* What is microeconomics
    - Microeconomics is the study of how individuals and firms make decisions in a world of scarcity.
    - It's a series of constrain optimization exercises where economic agents try to make themselves as well off as possible given their constrains. 

* There are tradeoffs and opportunity costs.

* Everything you do has an opportunity cost. Anything you do, you could be doing something else instead. 

### Supply and Demand Model
* Demand Curve
    * It's the relationship between the price of a good and how much people want it.  
* Market Equilibrium
    * Where the supply and demand curve meets is the market equilibrium. 
    * This is the point where both consumers and producers are happy making a transaction. 
* Positive Analysis and Normative Analysis
    * Positive Analysis - The study of the way things are. For eg. selling kidneys on ebay. Demand is extremely high, supply is very low, so the price will be very high. So, it makes economic sense.  
    * Normative Analysis - The study of the way things should be. For eg. Should we sell kidneys on ebay. What are the issues.

* Adam Smith believes there is an invisible hand in Capitalism that keeps things in check.
    * Invisible Hand View - Consumers and Firms serving their own best interest will do what is best for society. 
    * Best for society - Most stuff gets produced and consumed. Best for society means maximum surplus. Most stuff gets produced that people value. 

* What we will learn in this course:
    * How does individuals and firms acting in their own self interest, without caring about anybody else ends up yielding largest possible productive economy. 
    * We will start with demand, which is how do consumers decide what they want given their resources.
    * We will learn about utility maximization. I have a utility function that I can mathematically write down what I want. I will have a budget constraint, which is the resource I have. These two make up the constrain optimization problem. Given what I want and the resources I have what decisions do I make.
    * Then we will learn about supply. We will learn how firms decide what to produce. 
    * We will also learn how firms can operate in very different markets. There is a competitive market that Adam Smith envisioned. But that doesn't always work and then we get monopoly markets. 
    * Then we will try to understand market equilibrium and Smith's principles. 
    * Then we will look at the reality. How there are various market failures that can get in the way, why we have to care about equity and what implications that has, about behavioral economics etc.
